            The Event Flower Exchange Platform is designed to facilitate the buying and selling of surplus event flowers.
            Sellers are expected to provide honest and complete descriptions of the flowers listed, including condition, availability, and price.
            Buyers are responsible for reviewing listing details before purchasing, and all transactions take place directly between buyers and sellers.
